- Decide if to use Python or shell scripting (includes bash, PowerShell, batch files)
- Figure out how to easily pull values for variables from a text file
    - Alternatively, tell users to set environmental variables instead
- Figure out if we want to "front-end" Git or not.
    - I'm currently leaning towards no because a lot of the work is done by Git.
    - I don't think I should duplicate work that has been done by Git.
- Figure out how to publish the build files.
    - Find out if build directory for compiled jars are in the same location for both Forge and Fabric.
